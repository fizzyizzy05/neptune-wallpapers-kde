# Neptune Wallpapers
## About these wallpapers
I designed these wallpapers as part of the KDE Plasma 6 wallpaper competition. Neptune is designed to convey the theme of "**new beginnings**", which stems from the stated themes of trustworthiness, personal growth, and a reflection of me by being a new frontier that avoids the mistakes of the past and can be made into anything you want. It is designed with a glowing orb facing down at the bottom of the screen, highlighting the new floating-by-default panel in Plasma 6.

### Neptune (main)
This is the main wallpaper submitted as part of the contest. It features multiple shades of blue that come together to form a cohesive abstract orb - the name Neptune comes from Neptune being "*the blue planet*".
